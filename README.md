Utilizing quadtrees as the fundamental data structure, this project implements an image compression algorithm in C++. The compression process involves representing a square image in a hierarchical manner, with non-leaf nodes signifying divided regions and leaf nodes storing average color values for uniform blocks. The algorithm assesses color similarity and halts further division when a specified threshold is met, ensuring an efficient compression process. Decompression reconstructs the original image by traversing the quadtree and recreating each block based on stored color information. The use of quadtrees allows for a scalable and efficient approach, capturing both structure and color details during compression and decompression.
